Copilot said: The error message katana: command not found

The error message katana: command not found means that the Katana tool is not installed or its location is not in your system's PATH. Here’s how you can fix this issue on Kali Linux:
1. Check if Katana is Installed

You have a katana directory on your Desktop. Try running it directly from that directory:
bash

cd ~/Desktop/katana
ls
# Look for an executable file or README for instructions

If you see an executable file named katana or katana.py, try running:
bash

./katana -u https://example.com

or
bash

python3 katana.py -u https://example.com

**Install Katana (if not installed)**

If Katana is not installed, you can install it using Go (if it’s the project from projectdiscovery/katana):
bash

go install github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/cmd/katana@latest

Then add Go’s bin directory to your PATH (if it’s not already):

### export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin


**change katana path to desktop**


**Add Katana to PATH**

If you want to run katana from any directory, add its location to your PATH. For example, if the executable is in ~/Desktop/katana:
bash

### export PATH=$PATH:~/Desktop/katana ####
